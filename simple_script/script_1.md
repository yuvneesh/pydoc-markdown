<a id="script_1"></a>

# script\_1

<a id="script_1.name"></a>

#### name

This is a special comment.
We can use this to tell us about the variable in use i.e. name

<a id="script_1.last_name"></a>

#### last\_name

Alternatively, we can add as many lines of comment we want.
It will work as long as the last line has "#:" symbol.
